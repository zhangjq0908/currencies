# How To Contribute

## New Features

**For now, I don't want to accept any pull requests, which contain new features or widely changed
behavior.**

You are welcome to open issues to report bugs or suggest features, though. ðŸ™‚

## Bug fixes

You are welcome to provide pull requests with fixes for a bug you discovered.
Regarding code style: I don't dictate strict rules, but please try to stick to the original style as
good as possible.

You are invited to provide translations for the app. But there are some rules.

1. Please only translate if you are **fluid with the language** you provide the translation and
    also if you are **familiar with the nomenclature of the Android system**. If in doubt about a
    specific string, check out other Apps of big companies, like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google, etc.,
    and see how they did it.
2. Only contribute, if you are committed to translate the **majority** of strings. No one wants an
   app, which is a mix of English and the native language. I might remove translations again, if
   they won't receive updates on new string resources.

Translations can be provided via [Weblate](https://translate.codeberg.org/engage/currencies/).
